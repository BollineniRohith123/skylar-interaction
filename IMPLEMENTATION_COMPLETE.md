---

## 🔧 PHASE 1: Prompt & AI Logic Overhaul

### Changes Made

#### 1. **System Prompt Transformation** (`app/demo-config.ts`)

**Before**: Reactive AI waiting for user to mention budget  
**After**: Proactive AI with structured diagnostic flow

**Key Changes**:
- **New Opening**: AI immediately begins diagnostic process with 3 clear options
- **Diagnostic Flow Section**: Branching logic based on user's goal (Launch/Grow/Event)
- **Sequential Questions**: Goal → Brand Stage → Audience → Budget → Timeline
- **"The Why" Justification**: Comprehensive 5-step framework for explaining recommendations

**Lines Modified**: 150-163 (Opening), 109-135 (Tool Instructions), 137-163 (Justification Framework)

#### 2. **Tool Definitions Replaced** (`app/demo-config.ts`)

**Removed**: Single monolithic `createCampaignStrategy` tool  
**Added**: Three sequential tools for conversational flow

**New Tools**:
1. **`setCampaignGoal`** (Lines 304-327)
   - Parameters: `goal`, `brandStage`, `targetAudience`
   - Purpose: Captures strategic foundation
   - Event: Dispatches `campaignGoalDefined`

2. **`setCampaignTimeline`** (Lines 328-347)
   - Parameters: `budget`, `duration`
   - Purpose: Captures financial/timing parameters
   - Event: Dispatches `campaignTimelineDefined`

3. **`buildAndExplainStrategy`** (Lines 348-374)
   - Parameters: None (uses data from previous tools)
   - Purpose: Calculates final strategy with intelligent allocation
   - Event: Dispatches `campaignStrategyUpdated`

#### 3. **Client Tool Implementations** (`lib/clientTools.ts`)

**Added Global State** (Lines 3-11):
```typescript
let campaignState = {
  goal: '',
  brandStage: '',
  targetAudience: '',
  budget: 0,
  duration: 0
};
```

**New Tool Functions**:
- **`setCampaignGoalTool`** (Lines 54-80): Stores goal data, dispatches event
- **`setCampaignTimelineTool`** (Lines 82-108): Stores timeline data, dispatches event
- **`buildAndExplainStrategyTool`** (Lines 110-225): 
  - Intelligent allocation based on goal + brand stage
  - 6 different allocation strategies (startup launch, established launch, etc.)
  - Calculates impact metrics (impressions, reach, ROI, brand value)
  - Resets state after completion

**Updated `endCallTool`** (Lines 281-305): Now resets campaign state on call end

#### 4. **Tool Registration** (`lib/callFunctions.ts`)

**Added Imports** (Lines 4-12): All new tools imported  
**Registered New Tools** (Lines 108-140):
- `setCampaignGoal` → `setCampaignGoalTool`
- `setCampaignTimeline` → `setCampaignTimelineTool`
- `buildAndExplainStrategy` → `buildAndExplainStrategyTool`
- `endCall` → `endCallTool` (was missing before)
- Kept legacy `createCampaignStrategy` for backward compatibility

---

## 🎨 PHASE 2: UI/UX Evolution

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Progressive UI State Management** (`app/components/DetailedCampaignView.tsx`)

**New Interfaces** (Lines 27-36):
```typescript
interface CampaignGoalData {
  goal: string;
  brandStage: string;
  targetAudience: string;
}

interface CampaignTimelineData {
  budget: number;
  duration: number;
}
```

**New State Variables** (Lines 41-48):
- `campaignGoal`: Stores Stage 1 data (goal, brand stage, audience)
- `campaignTimeline`: Stores Stage 2 data (budget, duration)
- `campaignStrategy`: Stores Stage 3 data (complete strategy)
- `showGoalSection`, `showTimelineSection`, `showStrategySection`: Animation triggers

#### 2. **Event Listeners for Progressive Building** (Lines 50-115)

**Three New Event Handlers**:
1. **`handleCampaignGoalDefined`**: Receives goal data, triggers Stage 1 animation
2. **`handleCampaignTimelineDefined`**: Receives timeline data, triggers Stage 2 animation
3. **`handleCampaignStrategyUpdated`**: Receives full strategy, triggers Stage 3 animation

**Enhanced `handleCallEnded`**: Resets all state and animation flags

#### 3. **Progressive Rendering Logic** (Lines 160-207)

**Stage 1: Campaign Foundation** (Lines 164-186)
- Shows when `campaignGoal` exists
- Displays: Goal, Brand Stage, Target Audience
- Animation: `slide-in-up`

**Stage 2: Budget & Timeline** (Lines 188-207)
- Shows when `campaignTimeline` exists
- Displays: Total Investment, Campaign Duration
- Animation: `slide-in-up slide-in-delay-1`
- Count-up animation on numbers

**Stage 3: Media Mix & Impact** (Lines 209-481)
- Shows when `campaignStrategy` exists
- Displays: All 5 channel allocations, impact metrics, timeline, action buttons
- Animation: `slide-in-up slide-in-delay-2` and `slide-in-delay-3`

#### 4. **Animated Progress Bars** (Lines 237-336)

**Before**: Static width with transition  
**After**: Animated from 0% to target using CSS custom properties

```typescript
style={{'--target-width': `${campaignStrategy.allocation.aircraftAdvertising}%`} as React.CSSProperties}
className="progress-bar-animated"
```

Applied to all 5 channels: Aircraft, Outdoor, Digital, Transit, Traditional

#### 5. **Count-Up Animations** (Lines 383-421, 437)

Added `count-up` class to:
- Total Impressions
- Unique Reach
- Monthly Investment
- Brand Impact Value
- Expected ROI percentage

#### 6. **Dynamic Header Subtitle** (Lines 127-137)

Changes based on current stage:
- Stage 1: "Understanding your brand foundation..."
- Stage 2: "Building your customized strategy..."
- Stage 3: "A Proven Strategy for [Goal]"

#### 7. **Typing Indicator** (`app/page.tsx`, Lines 416-427)

Shows when `agentStatus === 'speaking'`:
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-4">
  <span className="text-gray-600">Skylar</span>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
    <span className="typing-dot"></span>
    <span className="typing-dot"></span>
    <span className="typing-dot"></span>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 8. **Text Reveal Animation** (`app/page.tsx`, Line 399)

Added `text-reveal` class to transcript items for streaming effect

**Slide-In Animations** (Lines 275-301):
- `slideInUp`: Base animation from bottom
- `slide-in-delay-1`, `slide-in-delay-2`, `slide-in-delay-3`: Staggered delays (0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s)

**Progress Bar Animation** (Lines 303-313):
- `progressFill`: Animates from 0% to target width
- Uses CSS custom property `--target-width`
- 1.5s duration with ease-out

**Count-Up Animation** (Lines 315-325):

```

### State Management

**Global Campaign State** (`lib/clientTools.ts`):
- Persists across sequential tool calls
- Resets on call end
- Enables buildAndExplainStrategy to access previous data

**Component State** (`DetailedCampaignView.tsx`):
- `campaignGoal`: Partial data from Stage 1
- `campaignTimeline`: Partial data from Stage 2
- `campaignStrategy`: Complete data from Stage 3
- Animation flags control progressive rendering

### Intelligent Allocation Logic

**6 Strategy Patterns** based on Goal + Brand Stage:

1. **New Startup Launch**: Digital-first (30% Aircraft, 30% Outdoor, 25% Digital)
2. **Established Brand Launch**: Premium focus (45% Aircraft, 25% Outdoor, 15% Digital)
3. **Startup Awareness**: Digital-heavy (25% Aircraft, 30% Outdoor, 30% Digital)
4. **Established Awareness**: Balanced (35% Aircraft, 30% Outdoor, 20% Digital)
5. **Event Promotion**: High visibility (35% Aircraft, 35% Outdoor, 20% Digital)
6. **Default**: Balanced approach (40% Aircraft, 25% Outdoor, 20% Digital)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: Complete Diagnostic Flow

1. **Start Call**: Click "Start Call" button
2. **AI Opens**: Should immediately ask about goal (Launch/Grow/Event)
3. **Choose "Launch"**: AI should ask about brand stage
4. **Say "New startup"**: AI should ask about target audience
5. **Say "Young professionals"**: AI should ask about budget
6. **Say "5 lakh"**: AI should ask about duration
7. **Say "3 months"**: AI should build strategy

**Expected UI Behavior**:
- After step 4: "Campaign Foundation" section slides in
- After step 6: "Budget & Timeline" section slides in below
- After step 7: Full strategy appears with animated progress bars

### Test Scenario 2: Progressive UI Animations

**Watch for**:
- Header subtitle changes at each stage
- Sections slide in from bottom with staggered delays
- Progress bars animate from 0% to final percentage
- Numbers count up with scale animation
- Typing indicator appears when AI is speaking

### Test Scenario 3: "The Why" Justification

After strategy is built, AI should explain:
1. Acknowledge user's goal and brand stage
2. Justify top allocation with specific reason
3. Justify secondary allocation
4. Connect to expected impact metrics
5. Offer next steps

**Example**: "Because you mentioned your goal is to Launch a new brand and your brand is a New startup, I've allocated 30% to Digital Advertising. This is because for a new startup, digital channels allow you to build initial brand presence cost-effectively..."

### Test Scenario 4: Call End & Reset

1. **Say "Thank you, goodbye"**: AI should use endCall tool
2. **Verify**: All campaign sections disappear
3. **Start New Call**: Should start fresh diagnostic flow
