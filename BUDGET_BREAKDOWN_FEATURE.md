## 🔧 **How It Works**

### User Flow
1. **User says**: "I have 5 lakh budget and want to generate 1000 quality leads"
2. **Agent analyzes** the request and determines optimal allocation
3. **Agent calls** `createBudgetBreakdown` tool with:
   - Total budget: 500000
   - Lead goal: 1000  
   - Aircraft: 40%
   - Outdoor: 25%
   - Digital: 20%
   - Transit: 10%
   - Traditional: 5%
4. **UI displays** the beautiful breakdown instantly
5. **Agent explains** why this allocation makes sense

### Budget Allocation Strategy
- **Aircraft Advertising** (35-45%): Premium, high-impact - Skylar's specialty
- **Outdoor Media** (20-30%): Wide reach with hoardings/billboards
- **Digital Advertising** (15-25%): Targeted campaigns, social media
- **Transit Media** (8-15%): Consistent visibility on buses/metro
- **Traditional Media** (3-10%): Brand credibility with TV/print
